# SnapLearn
An android interactive dictionary app

SnapLearn is an Android application that was initially designed for Ethiopian children to make their language learning process easier.
I noticed that Ethiopian parents living in the U.S. find it hard to teach their children the native language spoken in Ethiopia. To make
this process easier, I developed this app.

The app has two modes, Admin mode, and Lerner mode. In Admin mode, the admistrator has the capability to create a wordlist that is associated with a picture and a pronounciation of the word. Here is how it works. Let's say you see a chair and wanted your child to learn how to say chair in the language of your preference. In the Admin mode, you would take a picture of a chair and give it a category. Then, you add a voice recording, and text description with your preferred language. This will be saved in an SQL-Lite database on your Android phone. 

The second mode, the Lerner mode, has a list of categories a person can choose from. After selecting a certain category, a list of objects/words/descrptions will be displayed. When the user selects an object from the list, the picture of the object, a button that is associated to the recording, and a description of the object will pop up.
